We use a principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the embedding space in order to better match the dimensional space (2048 dimensions) to the real images. To evaluate this, we noise the synthesized images and compare the percentage increase starting from the first FID value of the respective dimensional reduction of the embedding space. Reduction of the dimensions of the embedding space provided a more accurate representation of the quality of the generated images.",
