We use a principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the embedding space in order to better match the dimensional space (2048 dimensions) to the real images. To evaluate this, we noise the synthesized images and compare the percentage increase starting from the first FID value of the respective dimensional reduction of the embedding space. Reduction of the dimensions of the embedding space provided a more accurate representation of the quality of the generated images.",

Embark on an adventure in the darkness and defeat enemies and bosses of increasing difficulty. Fight your way through 3 hand-crafted dungeon maps, from haunted graveyards to monster-filled forests to the empty tombs in the pyramids. Beware of what you'll find there! We have composed a melodic horror soundtrack to accompany you through the thrilling experience. This is a student project created in Godot 4.3. In a group of four students, we had two months to learn and customize different techniques and create this alpha version. The music is handcrafted and composed to immerse the player in a world of death, destruction and unease. The bosses will do anything to keep you on your toes, so don't take too much time to enjoy their animations. The skill tree allows you to spend your collected coins on buffs. Open the skill tree, go on a shopping spree and come back to finally kill the Grim Reaper!",
